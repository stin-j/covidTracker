Made our team (Justin Fan and Alvin Lee) and deicded on a topic (covid tracker) and team name (Inspirational).
(Justin) Created a program that reads data from webpage (readData.java)
Some websites for data:
https://corona.lmao.ninja/
https://api.caw.sh/docs/#/
https://covidactnow.org/data-api
https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/#featured-collections

(Justin) Made the code object oriented (WIP) and added new methods in main to convert the data in the link directly to a JSON Object and JSON Arrays. 
The method that converts the API to JSON Arrays kept giving me this error:
java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.json.simple.JSONArray cannot be cast to class org.json.simple.JSONObject (org.json.simple.JSONArray and org.json.simple.JSONObject are in unnamed module of loader 'app')
	at covidTracker.readData.dataInputArray(readData.java:68)
	at covidTracker.readData.main(readData.java:39)

I will hopefully fix this later.

(Alvin) added 2 classes dataContinent and dataCountry
failed attempt to fix the error

5/26
(Justin) made a simple UI (user interface) that doesn't have much on it. you click on it and it gives the coordinates of where you clicked
moved all files into src folder for better filepathing

5/26
(Alvin) fixed the ClassCastException in the readData file now the code runs successfully
Reformatted the output in the dataStates, dataContinents, and dataCountries classes

5/28
(Justin) previously, the code just spit out all the data in a long list
changed code so that user can search for specific data within the API database or type "all" for the long list again
accounts for invalid inputs

5/29
(Justin) corrected package names that conflicted with import statements

5/29
(Alvin) Created a JFrame with buttons, currently only the "all" button works
