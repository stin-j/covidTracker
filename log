Made our team (Justin Fan and Alvin Lee) and deicded on a topic (covid tracker) and team name (Inspirational).
(Justin) Created a program that reads data from webpage (readData.java)
Some websites for data:
https://corona.lmao.ninja/
https://api.caw.sh/docs/#/
https://covidactnow.org/data-api
https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/#featured-collections

(Justin) Made the code object oriented (WIP) and added new methods in main to convert the data in the link directly to a JSON Object and JSON Arrays. 
The method that converts the API to JSON Arrays kept giving me this error:
java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.json.simple.JSONArray cannot be cast to class org.json.simple.JSONObject (org.json.simple.JSONArray and org.json.simple.JSONObject are in unnamed module of loader 'app')
	at covidTracker.readData.dataInputArray(readData.java:68)
	at covidTracker.readData.main(readData.java:39)

I will hopefully fix this later.
