WHAT THIS PROJECT IS
====================
APCS End-of-Year Project (COVID-19 Edition)

This project is not meant to be a review or summary. Rather, it is an opportunity to explore and
create – to see if you can cause awesome things to happen using your coding skills. What you do
is completely up to you.
This is an individual or group (up to three people) project due on Monday, May 31.
Presentations will begin Tuesday, June 1. As a minimum, you will be expected to demonstrate
your final project (run it) and show the source code. It is recommended that you narrate your
development process – relate major challenges or obstacles overcome, tell your story.
There will be weekly Project Checkpoints starting Friday, May 7. At these checkpoints you will
review progress against plan. As a minimum, your team and theme should be ready by
Checkpoint 1.
Challenge yourself, but manage the risk. Complexity, sophistication, and elegance are desired,
but it’s FAR better to produce something simple that works vs. something more complex which
does not. Do not make an unauthorized major topic change without checking with us first. Plan
carefully.
You are strongly, strongly advised to keep a version history– any time you make a major change
to your source code, first make a copy of the unchanged version.
Resources and programs:
Google. Google. Google. A programmer’s best friend, arguably. You should not plagiarize
large chunks of code, however.
Stack Overflow. A good language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site
for programmers.
The Java API, of course. Look here to see what syntax to use and what methods are available.
Github. File-sharing software which automatically synchronizes between computers – add or
change a file on one computer and it’ll be changed on all. Preserves revision history.
Dropbox. File-sharing software which automatically synchronizes between computers – add or
change a file on one computer and it’ll be changed on all. Compared with Github, Dropbox
doesn’t have quite as good a revision history and, as far as I know, doesn’t allow
branching/forking. But, it does allow you to run the code and is easier to use.
Netbeans IDE. Good for rudimentary graphics – it lets you drag and drop. Unfortunately, more
complicated things are often an issue, the code may be long and messy, and without experience
you may have little idea what’s going on. It can also be annoying, e.g. things may not look the
way you intend.
email. We (or your friends) might be able to offer you assistance. You should NOT have your
friends write code for you, nor should you copy your friends’ code.

Checkpoints
1. May 7 – Form team, define theme, layout project schedule and milestones. Can’t have too
much overlap with other projects.
Subsequent checkpoints will be every Friday:
2. May 14 – decide Dropbox vs. Github, decide graphics vs. text-based, written concrete project
idea, delegation of tasks, milestone schedule
3. May 21 – progress vs. plan
4. May 28 – Comments in code, sign up for presentation date if you haven’t already
5. May 31 – project due
6. June 1 - June 8 – presentations (June 9 last day of school)
Food for Thought
Check whether there exists any problem around you, or some unfulfilled need.
Can you fix the problem or fill the need by writing code?
If Yes, maybe that's the best project for you.
Peer review
Each member of a group will submit their own personal assessment of what their team members
did.
MOSS scan - Your code will be MOSSed for plagiariam.
Grading Rubric
Difficulty 25
Creativity 15

Presentation 30
Total 100
Your project will be weighted 15% in calculating your overall semester grade.
